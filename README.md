# EENG311FinalProject: Dahlia Byles, Justin Olson, Kevin Greene, Sarah Rodpai
This is code utilized in the final project for the Colorado School of Mines EENG311 course. There are two separate codes within this repository. The first code creates a Swerling
1 target model. The second code creates a Swerling 3 target model. 
At the end of the Swerling 1 target mdoel code, there is code to calculate the Rayleigh PDF and CDF for the target model. 
At the end of the Swerling 3 target model code, there is code to calculate the Chi Square PDF and CDF for the target model.
To run this code, one many need to utilize: function helperRadarPulsePlot(ReceivePulse,threshold,t,tp,pulseplotnum)
